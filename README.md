## Project Description:
This project involves the classification of sentiments expressed in tweets using multiple machine learning classifiers. The goal is to build, evaluate, and compare different models to determine the most effective classifier for sentiment analysis. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation using various metrics.

## Project Objectives:
- Data Collection and Preparation: Collect and preprocess a dataset of tweets for sentiment analysis.
- Model Training: Train six different machine learning classifiers to predict tweet sentiments.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each classifier using multiple evaluation metrics.
- Comparison and Analysis: Compare the classifiers to determine the most effective model for sentiment analysis.

## Project Components:

Data Collection and Preparation:
- Dataset: A 'Tweets' dataset containing text data for sentiment analysis.
- Preprocessing Steps: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.


## Machine Learning Classifiers:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- Random Forest (RF)**
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- Decision Tree (DT)**
- Logistic Regression (LR)**
- Naive Bayes (NB)**


## Results:
- Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the highest accuracy of 0.73 and the highest F1 scores of 0.73 and 0.72, respectively, making them the most effective classifiers for sentiment analysis.
- Naive Bayes (NB) showed the lowest performance with an accuracy of 0.53 and an F1 score of 0.38, indicating poor balance between precision and recall.
-Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree (DT) showed moderate performance with varying accuracies and F1 scores.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to sentiment analysis using multiple machine learning classifiers. It highlights the importance of diverse evaluation metrics to gain a full understanding of each model's performance. Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine are recommended for sentiment classification tasks due to their superior performance. The project provides a solid foundation for further research and development in sentiment analysis and machine learning.
